# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

`cocina360` is a Spring Boot 4.1 backend (Java 25) structured as a **modular monolith** using Spring Modulith, following **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**. Persistence is backed by **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) used purely as a persistence layer — no Supabase-specific features (auth, realtime, storage) are used from the backend.

## Commands

```

## Architecture

### Modular Monolith (Spring Modulith)

Each top-level subpackage of `site.soulware.cocina360` is an autonomous module with enforced boundaries. Modules must not access each other's internal packages — cross-module communication happens only through **domain events** published on the Spring application event bus, or through explicitly exposed module APIs (classes in the module root package).

### DDD Layering (per module)

Each business module follows this internal layering:

```
<module>/
├── domain/
│   ├── model/
│   │   ├── aggregate/    ← aggregate roots only (extend AggregateRoot<ID> with AggregateId)
│   │   ├── entity/       ← owned entities (extend Entity<ID> with EntityId; no repository, no own events)
│   │   ├── valueobject/  ← value objects (records + @Embeddable)
│   │   ├── event/        ← domain events (past-tense facts, records)
│   │   ├── exception/    ← domain rule violations (extend DomainException)
│   │   ├── command/      ← command records passed to command services
│   │   └── query/        ← query records passed to query services
│   └── repository/       ← repository interfaces (domain contracts, no impl)
├── application/          ← command and query services; orchestrates domain, publishes events
├── infrastructure/       ← JPA entities/repos, repository adapters
└── interfaces/
    └── rest/
        ├── request/      ← @RequestBody records (validation annotations live here)
        └── response/     ← response records (from(Result) factory)
```

Rules:
- The `domain` layer has zero infrastructure or Spring dependencies.
- `application` services are the only place that coordinate domain objects, repositories, and event publishing.
- Command services are `@Transactional`; query services are `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`.
- Controllers call the command service (void), then the query service to return the updated state — two round-trips accepted to keep CQRS boundaries clean.
- HTTP controllers live in `interfaces/rest/`, not `infrastructure/`. Infrastructure is for JPA only.

### Aggregate Roots vs Owned Entities

Both live in the `aggregate/` package of their module, but they are structurally distinct:

| | Aggregate Root | Owned Entity |
|---|---|---|
| Extends | `AggregateRoot<ID>` | `Entity<ID>` |
| ID type | extends `AggregateId` | extends `EntityId` |
| Has repository | yes | no — accessed only through its root |
| Can exist alone | yes | no — only meaningful within its aggregate |
| Publishes events | yes | no — mutations are events of the root |

`AggregateId` and `EntityId` are both in `shared.domain.model.valueobject` and share the same UUID-based structure, but using the correct one makes the role of each class explicit.

### Shared Module (`shared/`)

Base classes that all modules reuse, located at `site.soulware.cocina360.shared`:

| Class / Interface | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `shared.domain.model.aggregate.Entity<ID>` | Base entity with identity-based equals/hashCode |
| `shared.domain.model.aggregate.AggregateRoot<ID>` | Extends `Entity`; collects `DomainEvent`s via `registerEvent()`, drained by `pullDomainEvents()` |
| `shared.domain.model.valueobject.ValueObject` | Marker interface; prefer Java `record` + `@Embeddable` for implementations |
| `shared.domain.model.valueobject.AggregateId` | Base class for all UUID-based aggregate identity value objects; extend to create typed IDs |
| `shared.domain.model.event.DomainEvent` | Marker interface for domain events; requires `occurredOn()`. Use `record` types |
| `shared.domain.model.exception.DomainException` | Base unchecked exception; carries `messageKey` + `messageArgs` for i18n resolution |
| `shared.domain.model.exception.EntityNotFoundException` | Thrown when an aggregate cannot be found; maps to HTTP 404 |
| `shared.domain.model.exception.BusinessRuleViolationException` | Thrown when a named business rule is violated; maps to HTTP 422 |
| `shared.domain.repository.DomainRepository<A, ID>` | Marker interface for domain repository contracts |
| `shared.infrastructure.rest.GlobalExceptionHandler` | `@RestControllerAdvice` — maps all exceptions to `ErrorResponse`; resolves messages via `MessageSource` |
| `shared.infrastructure.rest.ErrorResponse` | Standard error envelope: `{ status, error, message, timestamp }` |
| `shared.infrastructure.config.ValidationConfig` | Wires `LocalValidatorFactoryBean` to use the application `MessageSource` |

### Cross-Context ID References

When an aggregate in context A holds a reference to an aggregate that belongs to context B (i.e., stores its ID as a foreign key), that ID type must live in `shared.domain.model.valueobject` — not inside context B's own module. This keeps context A from importing context B's internal packages, preserving module boundary enforcement.

IDs that are only used as a type's own identity (never held as a foreign key by another context) stay inside their own module's `domain.model.valueobject`.

### Exception Conventions

- All domain exceptions extend `DomainException` and pass a **message key** (not a hardcoded string) to the super constructor, e.g. `super("error.profile.not_found_by_id", id)`.
- Each bounded context defines its own specific exception classes with the key burned in — application services never pass raw string keys.
- `GlobalExceptionHandler` resolves the key via `MessageSource` + `LocaleContextHolder.getLocale()` to produce a translated message.

### i18n

- The frontend (and Postman) sets the `Accept-Language` header (`en` or `es`).
- Spring's `AcceptHeaderLocaleResolver` picks up the locale automatically; default falls back to `en` (`spring.mvc.locale=en`).
- All user-facing messages live in `src/main/resources/messages.properties` and `messages_es.properties`, organized by bounded context using comment sections.
- Bean Validation constraint messages also resolve from these files (via `ValidationConfig`), using standard keys like `jakarta.validation.constraints.NotBlank.message`.

### Domain Events Flow

1. Aggregate calls `registerEvent(new SomethingHappened(...))` during a domain operation.
2. Application service calls `repository.save(aggregate)`.
3. After the transaction, the application service calls `aggregate.pullDomainEvents()` and publishes each event via `ApplicationEventPublisher`.
4. Other modules listen with `@ApplicationModuleListener` (Spring Modulith), ensuring transactional event delivery.

### Security / Auth

Authentication and authorization are **out of scope** for this service. An API gateway sits in front of this monolith and validates JWT tokens issued by Supabase Auth before any request reaches here. This service trusts that incoming requests are already authenticated — do not add Spring Security, JWT parsing, or any auth logic.

### Persistence (Supabase / PostgreSQL)

- Supabase is used exclusively as a hosted PostgreSQL instance — the app connects over JDBC like any PostgreSQL database.
- Connect via the **Supabase connection pooler** (PgBouncer), not the direct connection, to avoid IPv6 routing issues. Use `?sslmode=require&prepareThreshold=0` in the JDBC URL (`prepareThreshold=0` disables prepared statements, required for PgBouncer in transaction mode).
- `ddl-auto=none`: schema is managed externally (migrations via Flyway or Supabase dashboard SQL editor).
- JPA/Hibernate is confined to the `infrastructure` layer of each module. Domain objects are mapped via `@MappedSuperclass` from the shared base classes.

## Coding Style

- Always qualify instance field and method accesses with `this.` — this makes the scope of every reference explicit and reduces ambiguity for readers.
- When a method declaration's parameter list is too long to fit on one line, break each parameter onto its own line, indented one tab beyond the method's access modifier. The closing `)` and opening `{` go on their own line at the access modifier's indentation level:

```java
public static ControlFormat rehydrate(
    ControlFormatId id,
    ControlProcessId processId,
    String name,
    ControlFormatStatus status,
    List<FormatField> fields,
    Instant createdAt,
    Instant updatedAt
) {
    // body
}
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Value format |
|---|---|
| `DB_URL` | `jdbc:postgresql://<pooler-host>:5432/postgres?sslmode=require&prepareThreshold=0` |
| `DB_USERNAME` | `postgres.<project-ref>` (pooler format) |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Supabase DB password |
